# TITLE : Angies Horror Gallery
 
 This will be a web app where the user will play games
 the purpose of this app is for horror movie fans to stop by and have a little fun.
 the first three game ideas are:

 ##text adventure game:
 user chooses between options as the story progresses. at the end of either story a Gif is rendered.
 player choose between 2 options.

 ##card matching game:
Cards will be hard coded , As I plan to use horror movie characters. only a set of 12 to begin.
 or I'd also like to use match the gif, and use specific gifs to match.


 ##quizlet:
 Short quiz, if answered all correct will render gif
......


post MVP:
 It would be really cool to add some games which are more interactive and actually allow the use of horror movie character sprites.

would also love to add some sound effects when things are clicked and new pgs load.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
