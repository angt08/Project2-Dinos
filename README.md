# TITLE : Angies Horror Gallery
 
 This will be a fun web app where the user will play games
 the purpose of this app is for horror movie fans to stop by and have a little fun.
 the first three game ideas are:

 ##text adventure game:
 user choses between options as the story progresses. at hte end of either story a Gif is rendered

 ##card matching game:
 Cards will be hard coded , As i plan to use horror movie characters. only a set of 12 to begin.

 ##quizlet:
 Short quiz, if ansrwed all correct will render gif
......


post MVP
 It would be really cool to add some games which are more interactive and actually allow the use of horror movie character sprites.

 would also love to add some sound effects when things are clicked and new pgs load.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
